# this is an edge  dedcetion shader that respnds to the location of the cursor on the screen. 
# this was made from combining the sample code of the of other edge shader and the shader that responded to the cursor as well as changing the matrix that we are multiplying the samples by so make it sharper and more distinct than the one in the sample code.
